# LGN prosthesis
This report presents a proof-of-concept to partially restore vision in glaucoma-blind patients by targeting the LGN. We will start by introducing the disease, and the targetâ€™s choice. Then we will describe the general design of our prosthesis, how to transfer data and power to it, and finally how we will analyze the results in order to test our device.
